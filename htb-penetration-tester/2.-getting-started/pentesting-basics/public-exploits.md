# Public Exploits

### Finding Public Exploits

Many tools can help us for public exploits for various applications and services we may encounter during the enumeration phase. One way is  to Google for the application name with **`exploit`** to see if we get any results.

A well-known tool for this purpose is **`searchsploit`**, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application. We can install it with the following command :&#x20;

```shell-session
$ sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```

Then, we can use **`searchsploit`** to search a specific application by its name, as follows :&#x20;

```shell-session
$ searchsploit openssh 7.2

OpenSSHd 7.2p2 - Username Enumeration      
```

We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like **`Exploit DB`**, **`Rapid7 DB`**, **Vulnerability Lab**.

## Metasploit Primer

The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is an excellent tool for pentesters. It contains many built-in exploits for many public vulnerabilities and provides an easy way to use exploits against vulnerable targets. MSF has many other features, like :&#x20;

* Running reconnaissance scripts to enumerate remote hosts and compromised targets
* Verification scripts to test the existence of a vulnerability without actually compromising the target
* Meterpreter, which is a great tool to connect to shells and runs commands on the compromised targets
* Many post-exploitation and pivoting tools
* Let us take a basic example of searching for an exploit for an application we are attacking&#x20;
