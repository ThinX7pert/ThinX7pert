# Web Enumeration

## Gobuster

After discovering a web application, it is always worth checking to see if we can uncover any hidden files or directories on the webserver that are not intended for public access. We can use a tool such as **`ffuf`** or **`Gobuster`** to perform this directory enumeration. Sometimes we will find hidden functionality or pages/directories exposing sensitive data that can be leveraged to access the web application or even remote code execution on the web server itself.

### Directory/File Enumeration

Gobuster is a versatile tool that allows for performing DNS, **`vhost`**, and directory brute-forcing. The tool has additional functionality, such as enumeration of public AWS S3 buckets. For this module's purposes, we are interested in the directory (and file) brute-forcing modes specified with the switch **`dir`**. Let us run a simple scan using the **`dirb common.txt`** worldlist.

```shell-session
$ gobuster dir -u http://10.10.10.121/ -w /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt

```

An HTTP status code of **`200`** reveals that the resource's request was successful, while a 403 HTTP status code indicates that we are forbidden to access the resource. A 301 status code indicates that we are being redirected, which is not a failure case.

The scan was completed successfully, and it identifies a WordPress installation at **`/wordpress`**. WordPress is the most commonly used CMS (Content Management System) and has an enormous potential attack surface? In this case, visiting **`http://10.10.10.121/wordpress`** in a browser reveals that WordPress is still in setup mode, which allow us to gain remote code execution (RCE) on the server.

### DNS Subdomain Enumeration

There also may be essential resources hosted on subdomains, such as admin panels or applications with additional with functionality that could be exploited. We can use **`Gobuster`** to enumerate available subdomains of a given domain using the **`dns`** flag to specify DNS mode. First, let us clone the **`SecLists`** GitHub repo, which contains many useful lists for fuzzing and exploitation :&#x20;

### Installing SecLists

```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
$ sudo apt install seclists -y
```

Next, add a DNS Server such as 1.1.1.1 to the **`/etc/resolv.conf`** file. We will target the domain **`inlanefreight.com`**, the website for a fictional freight and logistics company.

```shell-session
$ gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/namelist.txt

This scan reveals several interesting subdomains that we could examine further.

### Web Enumeration Tips

### Banner Grabbing / Web Server Headers

Web server headers provide a good picture of what is hosted on a web server. They can reveal the specific application framework in use, the authentication options, and whether the server is missing essential security options or has been misconfigured. We can use **`curl`** to retrieve server header information from the command line. **`curl`** is another essential addition to our penetration testing toolkit, and familiarity with its many options encouraged.

```bash
$ curl -IL https://www.inlanefreight.com

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Fri, 18 Dec 2020 22:24:05 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Link: <https://www.inlanefreight.com/>; rel=shortlink
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

Another handy tool is **`EyesWitness`**, which can be used to take screenshots of target web applications, fingerprint them, and identify possible default credentials.
