## What is Shell ?

On a Linux system, the **shell** is a program that takes input from the user via the keyboard and passes these commands to the operating system to perform a specific function.

Most Linux systems use a program called **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** as a shell program to interact with the operating system. Bash is an enhanced (improve) version of **sh**, the Unix system's original shell program. Aside from **bash,** there are other shells, including **Zsh**, **Tcsh**, **Ksh**, etc.

We will often read about or hear others talking about "getting a shell" on a box (system). This means that the target host has been exploited, and we have obtained shell-level access and can run commands interactively as if we are sitting logged into the host. A shell may be obtained by exploiting a web application or network/service vulnerability or obtaining credentials and logging into the target host remotely. There are three main types of shell connections :&#x20;



<table><thead><tr><th width="174">Shell Type</th><th width="446">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Reverse Shell</td><td>Initiates a connection back to a "listener" on our attack box.</td></tr><tr><td>Bind Shell</td><td>"Binds" to a specific port on the target host and waits for a connection from our attack box.</td></tr><tr><td>Web Shell</td><td>Runs operating system commands via the web browser, typically not interactive or semi-interactive. It can also be used to run single commands.</td></tr></tbody></table>

Each type of shell has its use case, and the same way there are many ways to obtain shell, the helper program that we use to get a shell can be written in many languages. These can be small scripts or larger, more complex programs to facilitate a connection from the target host back to our attacking system and obtain "shell" access.

## What is a Port ?

A port can be thought of as a window or door on a house (the house being a remote system), if a window or door is left open or not locked correctly, we can often gain unauthorized access to a home. This is similar in computing. Ports are virtual points where network connections begin and end.  They are software-based and managed by the host operating system. Port are associated with a specific process or service and allow computers to differentiate between different traffic types.

Each port assigned a number, and may are standardized across all network-connected devices (though a service can be configured to run a non-standard port). Ports numbers allow us to access specific services or applications running on target devices. Port numbers allow us to access specific services or applications running on target devices. At a very high level, port help computers understand how to handle the various types of date they receive.

There are two categories of ports, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and User Datagram (UDP) :&#x20;

* **TCP** : Connection-oriented, meaning that a connection between a client and a server must be established before data can be sent. The server must be in a listening state, awaiting connection requests from clients.
* **UDP** : Connectionless communication model. There is no "handshake" and therefore introduces a certain amount of unreliability since there is no guarantee of data delivery. **UDP** is useful when error correction/checking is either not needed or is handled by the application itself. UDP is suitable for applications that run time-sensitive tasks, since dropping packets is faster than waiting for delayed packets due to retransmission, as is the case with **TCP** and can significantly affect a real-time system. There are 65,535 **TCP** ports and 65,535 **UDP** different ports, each denoted by a number.

Some of the most well-known **TCP** and **UDP** ports are listed below  :&#x20;

| Port(s)         | Protocol              |
| --------------- | --------------------- |
| `20`/`21` (TCP) | `FTP`                 |
| `22` (TCP)      | `SSH`                 |
| `23` (TCP)      | `Telnet`              |
| `25` (TCP)      | `SMTP`                |
| `80` (TCP)      | `HTTP`                |
| `161` (TCP/UDP) | `SNMP`                |
| `389` (TCP/UDP) | `LDAP`                |
| `443` (TCP)     | `SSL`/`TLS` (`HTTPS`) |
| `445` (TCP)     | `SMB`                 |
| `3389` (TCP)    | `RDP`                 |
