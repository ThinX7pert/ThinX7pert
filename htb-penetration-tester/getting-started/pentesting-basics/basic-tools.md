# Basic Tools

## Using SSH

**Secure Shell (SSH)** is a network protocol runs on port **22** by default and provides users such as system administrators a secure way to access a computer remotely. SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless, using **public-key authentication** using an SSH public/private key pair.

SSH uses a client-server model, connecting a user running an SSH client application such as **OpenSSH** to an SSH server. While attacking a box or during a real-world assessment, we often obtain clear text credentials or an SSH private key that can be leveraged to connect directly to a system via SSH. An SSH connection is typically much more stable than a reverse shell connection and can often be used as a "jump host" to enumerate and attack other hosts in the network, transfer tools to set up persistence, etc. :&#x20;

```bash
$ ssh <username>@<remote server IP> # eg
$ ssh bob@10.10.10.10
```

It is also possible to read local private keys on a compromised system or add our public to gain SSH access to a specific user.

## Using Netcat

**Netcat**, **ncat** or **nc**, is an excellent network utility for interacting with TCP/UDP ports. It can be used for many things during a penstest. Its primary usage is for connecting to shells. In addition to that, **netcat** can be used to connect to any listening port and interact with the service running on that port. For example, **SSH** is programmed to handle connections over port 22 to send all data and keys. We can connect to TCP port 22 with netcat :&#x20;

```bash
$ netcat 10.10.10.10 22
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.4p1 Debian-3
```

As we can see, port 22 sent us a banner, starting that **SSH** is running on it. This technique is called **Banner Grabbing**, and can help identify what service is running on a particular port. There's another Windows alternative to **netcat** coded in PowerShell called **PowerCat**. **Netcat** can be used to transfer files between machines.

Another similar network utility is **socat**, which has few features that **netcat** does not support, like forwarding ports and connecting to serial devices. **Socat** can also be used to **upgrade a shell to a fully interactive TTY**. A **standalone binary** of **Socat** can be transferred to a system after obtaining remote code execution to get a more stable reverse shell connection.

## **Optional Exercises**

Apply what you learned in this section to grab the banner of the above server and submit it as the answer.

```bash
$ netcat 94.237.49.182 54800
SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_8.2p1 Ubuntu-4ubuntu0.1
```
