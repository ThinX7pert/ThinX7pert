# Basic Tools

## Using SSH

**Secure Shell (SSH)** is a network protocol runs on port **22** by default and provides users such as system administrators a secure way to access a computer remotely. SSH can be configured with password authentication or passwordless, using **public-key authentication** using an SSH public/private key pair.

SSH uses a client-server model, connecting a user running an SSH client application such as **OpenSSH** to an SSH server. While attacking a box or during a real-world assessment, we often obtain clear text credentials or an SSH private key that can be leveraged to connect directly to a system via SSH. An SSH connection is typically much more stable than a reverse shell connection and can often be used as a "jump host" to enumerate and attack other hosts in the network, transfer tools set up persistence, etc. :&#x20;

```
ssh <username>@<remote server IP>
ssh bob@10.10.10.10
```
