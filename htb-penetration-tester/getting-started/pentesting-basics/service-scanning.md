# Service Scanning

## Nmap (Network Mapper)

**Nmap** is an open source tool for network exploration security and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services those hosts are offering, what operating systems they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.

Let us start with the most basic scan. Suppose that we want to perform a basic scan against a target residing at **10.129.42.253**. To do this, we should type "**nmap 10.129.42.253"** and hit return. We see that the **Nmap** scan was completed very quickly. This because if we don't specify any additional options, Nmap will only scan the **1,000** most common ports by default. The scan output reveals that ports 21, 22, 80, 139, and 445 are available :&#x20;

```bash
$ nmap 10.129.42.253

```

* Under the **PORT** heading, it also tells us that these are TCP ports. By default, Nmap will conduct a TCP scan unless specifically requested to perform a UDP scan.
* The **STATE** heading confirms that these ports are **open**. Sometimes we will see other ports listed that have a different state, such as **filtered**. This can happen if a firewall is only allowing access to the ports from specific addresses.
* The **SERVICE** heading tells us the service's name is typically mapped to the specific port number. However, the default scan will not tell us what is listening on that port. Until we instruct **Nmap** to interact with the service and attempt to tease out identifying information, it could be another service altogether.

As we gain familiarity, we will notice that several ports are commonly associated with Windows or Linux. Let us run a more advanced **Nmap** scan and gather more information about target device.

We can use the **-`sC`** parameter to specify that **Nmap** scripts should be used to try and obtain more detailed information. The **-`sV`** parameter instructs **Nmap** to perform a version scan. The version scan is underpinned by a comprehensive database of over 1,000 services signatures. Finally, **`-p-`** tells Nmap that we want to scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

```bash
$ nmap -sV -sC -p- 10.129.42.253

```

This returns a lot more information. We see that it took a lot longer to scan 65,535 ports than 1,000 ports. The **`-sC`** and **`-sV`** options also increase the duration of a scan, as instead of performing a simple TCP handshake, they perform a lot more checks. We notice that this time there is a VERSION heading, which reports the service version and the operating system, if this is possible to identify.

So far, we know that the operating system is Ubuntu Linux. Application versions can also help reveal the target OS version. Take OpenSSH, for example. We see the reported version is **`OpenSSH 8.2p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0.1`**. From inspection of other Ubuntu SSH package changelogs, we see the release version takes the format **`1:7.3p1-1ubuntu0.1`**. Updating our version to fit this format, we get **`1:8.2p1-4ubuntu0.1`**. A quick search for this version online reveals that it is included in Ubuntu Linux Focal Fossa 20.04. Another quick search reveals that the release date of this OS is April 23rd, 2020.

### Nmap scripts

Specifying **`-sC`** will run many useful default scripts against a target, but there are cases when running a specific script is required. For example, in an assessment scope, we may be asked to audit a large Citrix installation. We could use a **`Nmap`** script to audit for the serve Citrix NetScaler vulnerability (**CVE-2019-19781**), while Nmap also has other script to audit a Citrix installation.

The syntax for running a Nmap script is **`nmap --script <script name> -p<port> <host>`**. **`Nmap`** script are a great way to enhance our scans' functionality, and inspection of the available options will pay dividends.

## Attacking Network Services

### Banner Grabbing

As previously discussed, banner grabbing is a useful technique to fingerprint a service quickly. Often, a service will look to identify itself by displaying a banner once a connection is initialized. Nmap will attempt to grab the banners if the syntax **`nmap -sV --script=banner <target>`** is specified. We can also attempt this manually using **`Netcat`**. Let us take another example, using **`nc`** version of **`Netcat`** :&#x20;

```bash
$ nc -nv 10.129.42.253 21
(UNKNOWN) [10.129.42.253] 21 (ftp) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
```

This reveals that the version of **`vsFTPd`** on the server is **`3.0.3`**. We can also automate this process using **`Nmap's`** powerful scritping engine:&#x20;

</strong></code></pre>
